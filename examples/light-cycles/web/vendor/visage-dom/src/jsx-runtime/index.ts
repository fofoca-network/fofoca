/**
 * Optional JSX front end.
 *
 * This module is a leaf: it imports from `element.ts` and `types.ts`, and
 * nothing in the library imports it back. `src/index.ts` in particular does not
 * re-export `Fragment`, so a consumer who never writes JSX never pulls this
 * file into their module graph. `test/optional.test.ts` enforces that.
 *
 * There is no second element model here — JSX compiles to the same
 * `createElement` calls `tags` makes, so both front ends produce identical
 * `ElementNode`s and drive the same reconciler.
 *
 * Enable per project with:
 *
 *     "jsx": "react-jsx",
 *     "jsxImportSource": "visage"
 *
 * Those settings apply only to `.tsx` files, which is what makes the layer
 * opt-in by file extension.
