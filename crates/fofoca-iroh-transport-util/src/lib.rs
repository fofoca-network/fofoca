//! The two pieces both custom iroh transports need and neither can host.
//!
//! `fofoca-iroh-webrtc-transport` and `fofoca-iroh-multihop-transport` are
//! deliberately standalone: neither depends on the other, and neither depends
//! on `fofoca-util` — so a shared helper has nowhere else to live.
//!
//! That is the whole justification for a crate this small. Unlike the two
//! crates recently folded back into `fofoca-protocol`, this one is not
//! isolating a dependency it could have inherited; it exists because there is
//! no other sharing point between two otherwise-independent crates. It adds no
//! external dependency — `iroh` is already in both manifests.
