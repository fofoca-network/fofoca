//! The wasm-bindgen harness server.
//!
//! `wasm-bindgen-test-runner` has two modes. Its default drives a browser
//! itself over `WebDriver`, which means finding a driver that matches the browser
//! — and for Chrome that meant downloading a chromedriver pinned to a Chrome
//! build. Its `NO_HEADLESS=1` mode instead just *serves* the harness and leaves
//! the browsing to whoever asks.
//!
//! That is the mode used here. The page runs its tests on load and publishes
//! `#matrix-done` once every cell has a row, so any way of driving a browser to
//! a URL and reading an element is enough — which is what lets the two backends
//! next door be as different as CDP and `WebDriver` and still answer the same
//! question.
