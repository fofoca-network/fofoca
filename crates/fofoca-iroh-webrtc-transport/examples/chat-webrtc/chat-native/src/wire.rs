//! [`chat_proto`]'s sans-io frame format, applied to iroh's streams.
//!
//! Two functions, and a rule about how they may be used: **never call
//! [`read_msg`] as a branch of a `select!`**. It performs two reads — a header,
//! then a body sized by it — and a cancelled future between them leaves the
//! stream positioned mid-frame with no way to resynchronise. Every reader here
//! therefore owns its stream in a task of its own and hands decoded messages on
//! through a channel, which is cancel-safe in a way a half-read frame is not.
