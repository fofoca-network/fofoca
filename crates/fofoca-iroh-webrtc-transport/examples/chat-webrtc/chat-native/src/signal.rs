//! The JSEP exchange, carried by the iroh relay.
//!
//! **The relay is the rendezvous, not the data path.** One short-lived
//! connection on [`chat_proto::SIGNAL_ALPN`] carries one
//! [`SignalEnvelope`] each way and closes. Nothing of the chat ever crosses it;
//! it exists to introduce two peers who cannot yet reach each other, and the
//! data channel that introduction produces carries everything after.
//!
//! That is the whole reason this example has no signaling server to deploy. A
//! conventional WebRTC demo needs a `WebSocket` broker with its own address, its
//! own TLS and its own uptime; iroh already runs an authenticated,
//! NAT-traversing rendezvous, and an ALPN on it is enough.
//!
//! Three rules here are load-bearing, and each is a bug that was paid for
//! upstream:
//!
//! 1. **The remote's identity comes from the connection, never the envelope.**
//!    `SignalEnvelope` carries a claimed endpoint id; over an authenticated
//!    carrier the TLS-proven [`Connection::remote_id`] is the real one. Keying
//!    a session by the claim would let any peer attach a session under someone
//!    else's name — impersonation, on a registry keyed by peer.
//! 2. **The answerer writes its answer before completing the negotiation.**
//!    Completing first waits for a data channel the offerer cannot open until
//!    it has the answer, and both sides sit there until a deadline fires.
//! 3. **Negotiation happens off the accept future.** Candidate gathering plus
//!    the DTLS/SCTP handshake takes seconds; holding the Router's accept task
//!    that long serialises inbound offers, so two tabs joining at once would
//!    queue.
