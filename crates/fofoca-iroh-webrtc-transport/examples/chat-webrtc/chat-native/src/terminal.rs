//! are plumbed — the host's messages arrive from a [`Membership`] and its lines
//! go straight into the [`Room`](crate::room::Room); a joiner's arrive off a
//! QUIC stream and its lines go back out over one. Both are reduced to the same
//! pair here: a receiver of [`ServerMsg`], and a closure that sends a line.
