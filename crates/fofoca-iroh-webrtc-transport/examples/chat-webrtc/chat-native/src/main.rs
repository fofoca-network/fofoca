//! A chat room over iroh, reachable from a terminal and from a browser tab.
//!
//! The room is a native process. Peers join it from a terminal (this binary,
//! `join`) or from a tab (`chat-web`, next door). Every peer↔room link is one
//! QUIC connection; a tab's rides a `WebRTC` data channel, which is the thing
//! this example exists to show.
//!
//! There is no signalling server. The iroh relay two peers already use to find
//! each other carries the JSEP exchange on an ALPN of its own, and the data
//! channel that produces carries everything after — see [`signal`].
//!
//! Run `chat-native host`, then follow the two lines it prints.
