//! The browser backend against a real browser — the wasm mirror of
//! `loopback.rs`.
//!
//! The fast suite: four tests, a few seconds, green or red. The harness it
//! runs on (and how to invoke it) is documented in `browser_harness/mod.rs`;
//! the slow configuration sweep is `browser_matrix.rs`.
//!
//! ## Why this file exists
//!
//! Browser↔**browser** bulk transfer had never been exercised. Browser↔native
//! is what `docs/perf/` benchmarked (4–19 MB/s), and it exercises exactly one
//! of these pumps — the other end is `native::`, which is a different
//! implementation with different queues. A consumer driving two Chrome
//! instances found the pairing that had no coverage: small traffic and a ~9 KB
//! request/response round pass, then the first bulk read never answers and the
//! wire counters stay flat.
//!
//! So the tests below are deliberately staged — a small round first, then a
//! bulk one — because "small passes, bulk stalls" is the whole signature, and a
//! suite that only proved bytes can move at all would have gone on passing
//! throughout.
//!
//! Not in CI: it needs a browser and a way to drive one, like
//! `fofoca-blobs/tests/opfs_browser.rs`.
