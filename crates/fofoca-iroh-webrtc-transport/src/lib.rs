//! QUIC datagrams over a `WebRTC` data channel, as an iroh custom transport —
//! on the host and in the browser.
//!
//! One data channel per remote peer, one QUIC datagram per binary SCTP
//! message, no extra framing. The channel is negotiated **unreliable and
//! unordered** (`maxRetransmits: 0`): QUIC above it owns loss recovery and
//! congestion control, so reliable ordered SCTP underneath would stack a
//! second retransmission loop on every loss. Structure follows
//! [fofoca-iroh-multihop-transport](https://github.com/fofoca-network/fofoca/tree/main/crates/fofoca-iroh-multihop-transport)
//! and the upstream
//! [iroh-tor-transport](https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh-tor-transport):
//! a transport factory, a per-endpoint receiver, a registry-backed sender, and
//! a per-session driver pumping the connection.
//!
//! # Why one crate with two backends
//!
//! `str0m` and `tokio` do not target `wasm32`; `web-sys` does not exist off the
//! browser. The *drivers* therefore cannot be one implementation. But the
//! protocol — the JSEP envelope, the transport id, the address convention — is
//! identical, and it is exactly the part that must not drift: two peers that
//! disagree about the transport id or the envelope shape fail to connect with
//! no useful error.
//!
//! So the protocol half lives at the crate root, always compiled and free of
//! host- and browser-only dependencies, and each backend sits behind a feature:
//!
//! - `native` — sans-io [`str0m`] driven by tokio, plus STUN gathering ([`stun`]).
//! - `web` — the browser's own `RTCPeerConnection` through `web-sys`.
//!
//! Neither is on by default; a consumer enables the one matching its target.
//!
//! # NAT traversal
//!
//! `str0m` gathers no candidates — it owns no sockets, so discovery is the
//! caller's job. Skipping it (as the experiment this was ported from did) means
//! advertising a single host candidate on a private interface, which connects
//! on one LAN and nowhere else. [`stun`] closes that on the host side; the
//! browser's ICE agent does it natively once given `iceServers`.
//!
//! The iroh relay carries the SDP exchange. **TURN is refused** — see
//! [`accept_ice_uri`]: a consumer that cannot pair directly falls back to that
//! same iroh relay rather than to a second relay at the ICE layer. Neither
//! backend has a TURN client, and neither should grow one.

mod addr;
mod ice_uri;
// Consumed by the browser backend. The host backend has its own equivalent in
// `native::session`, built the same way for the same reasons — a generation per
// session, and teardown on drop rather than on a cleanup branch.
//
// Compiled in every configuration even so, because this is the only place that
// logic is provable *cheaply*: the browser backend needs a real browser and a
// webdriver to test (there is no `RTCPeerConnection` in node, and CI has no
// webdriver), so its decisions were pulled out into a payload-generic type that
// `cargo test` reaches whatever features are on.
//
// "Cheaply", not "at all", as this used to say: `tests/browser_loopback.rs`
// does drive the browser backend end to end against Chrome, and it is where a
// question about the *transport* — as opposed to this registry's bookkeeping —
// gets answered. It is a local run, not a CI one.
