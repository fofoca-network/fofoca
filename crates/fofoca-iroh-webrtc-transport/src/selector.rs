//! Path selection that makes the relay a **rendezvous**, not a transport:
//! prefer a direct IP path, then `WebRTC`, and fall to the relay only when
//! neither is available.
//!
//! # Why a selector at all
//!
//! The relay is load-bearing for *signalling* — the JSEP exchange rides it —
//! so by the time the mount dial happens, the endpoint's address book already
//! holds a warm relay path for that peer. iroh merges a dial's address into
//! that book and fans the Initial out across everything it knows, so targeting
//! a `WebRTC`-only `EndpointAddr` does not keep the relay out of the race; the
//! warm path simply answers first.
//!
//! That alone would be recoverable — iroh re-selects as paths open. The part
//! that is not is iroh's default `BiasedRttPathSelector`, which skips any path
//! whose stats are not readable yet, and re-selection that fires only on
//! connection/path events with no periodic pass. A `WebRTC` path that opens a
//! moment before its first RTT sample is skipped exactly once and the relay
//! stays selected for the life of the connection. [`best_of`] is the fix: an
//! unmeasured path is a live candidate, not a non-candidate.
//!
//! # Why this is not "drop the relay"
//!
//! Only the *data plane* moves. iroh exposes no way to close a path, and the
//! demoted relay path is what lets a connection survive a dead data channel —
//! so the relay stays open and unused rather than being torn down.
