//! Runs the light-cycles simulation under `SyncTestSession`.
//!
//! This is the check every consumer of `fofoca-netplay` is told to run,
//! applied to this example. It forces a rollback on every frame and
//! compares the state checksum before and after re-simulating, so any
//! dependence on something other than `(state, inputs)` — a clock, a
//! hashed-collection iteration order, an accumulator that is not part of
//! the saved state — shows up here rather than as a desync between two
//! real players.
//!
//! It is also what would have caught the bug this example used to have:
//! the arena was laid out from a *live* estimate of who was present, so
//! two peers could derive different spawns for the same round and diverge
//! immediately. The roster is now fixed by the lobby before a match
//! starts.
