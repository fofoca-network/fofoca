//! The highest-value test in this example: two independent bots on a
//! loopback-only mesh (no internet, no relay — `LookupOpts::loopback()`
//! makes zero external network calls, so this runs offline and in CI)
//! play a whole match against each other and independently derive the
//! same outcome, having exchanged nothing but per-tick inputs.
//!
//! That is the central claim of the example — GGPO-style rollback over a
//! fofoca mesh, no authoritative peer, no state on the wire — checked
//! end-to-end rather than just in the simulation (`sim.rs`'s own tests
//! cover that half, and `sync_test.rs` covers determinism).
