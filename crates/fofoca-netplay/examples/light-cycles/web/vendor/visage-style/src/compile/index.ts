/**
 * Style object → the text of one `<style>` element.
 *
 * The output is a prelude-less `@scope` block, which the browser scopes to the
 * `<style>` element's own parent. That is the entire scoping mechanism: no
 * class, no hash, no attribute, no registry, and so nothing that can collide.
 *
 * Selectors are flattened rather than nested. Native nesting would express the
 * same thing in fewer bytes, but flattening costs nothing at runtime, reads
 * unambiguously in DevTools, and sidesteps a real portability question — engines
 * disagree about declarations that follow a nested block, and happy-dom drops
 * them outright. Every emitted selector starts at `:scope` for the same reason:
 * inside `@scope` a bare `img` already means `:scope img`, and writing it out
 * removes the need to know that.
