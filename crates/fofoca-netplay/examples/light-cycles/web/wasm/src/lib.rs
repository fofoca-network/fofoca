//! The web `light-cycles` client's wasm half: game logic, the
//! `fofoca-netplay` embedding (`app`), and the deterministic
//! `grid`/`round`/`sim` machinery — all this crate's own copy,
//! independent of `native/game`'s (see the plan's "Workspace layout").
//!
//! This file is the one thing with no native counterpart to mirror: the
//! wasm-bindgen JS API a `requestAnimationFrame` loop drives —
//! [`LightCyclesPeer::join`], [`LightCyclesPeer::turn`],
//! [`LightCyclesPeer::frame`], [`LightCyclesPeer::hud`],
//! [`LightCyclesPeer::drain_events`].
//!
//! `frame()` is also where the simulation is *paced*, and that is
//! load-bearing rather than a convenience. A rollback session advances
//! exactly one simulation tick per `Game::tick`, so driving it straight
//! off rAF would run this client at the display's refresh rate — 60 Hz
//! against the terminal client's 20 — and the two would not be playing
//! the same game. The accumulator below decouples the two: render as
//! often as the browser likes, simulate at [`grid::TICK_MS`].
