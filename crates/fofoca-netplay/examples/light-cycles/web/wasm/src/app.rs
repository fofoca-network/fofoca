//! The `fofoca-netplay` embedding: the [`Config`] that names this game's
//! three types, and [`Game`], which drives a lobby and one rollback
//! session per match.
//!
//! There is no `NodeApp`/`NodeDriver` here any more — `RollbackDriver` is
//! one, and it is what `main.rs` hands to `Node::spawn`. Nor is there any
//! netcode: prediction, rollback, input redundancy, acks and desync
//! detection all live in the library. What is left is a game.
//!
//! One consequence worth naming, because it deleted a whole class of bug:
//! the roster is now **fixed when the match starts**, agreed by the lobby,
//! rather than re-estimated from liveness on every tick. Two peers can no
//! longer briefly disagree about who is playing and lay out different
//! arenas.
//!
//! This crate's own copy of `native/game`'s, deliberately kept in step
//! with it: the two clients share no code, but they do share a match, so
//! the tuning constants below and the order of operations in
//! [`Game::tick`] have to agree.
