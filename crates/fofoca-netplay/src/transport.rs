//! What crosses the wire, and the seam it crosses through.
//!
//! The real transport is a fofoca mesh — that is what this crate is for, and
//! [`crate::fofoca_transport`] is the implementation consumers actually use.
//! The trait exists for two reasons: the protocol below has to be testable
//! against injected packet loss and reordering without standing up a mesh,
//! and a consumer embedding this somewhere other than fofoca should not have
//! to fork it.
//!
//! # What the transport must and must not guarantee
//!
//! **Must not:** ordering, deduplication, or delivery. This layer assumes
//! datagram semantics and handles all three itself — sequence numbers on
//! sync, redundant input resends, and idempotent input application.
//!
//! That is not a lowest-common-denominator assumption, it is what fofoca
//! actually provides: `send_app` opens a fresh unidirectional QUIC stream per
//! frame (`transport/pool.rs`), so frames are individually reliable but
//! **unordered relative to each other**, and `send_if_warm` is
//! fire-and-forget, so they can be lost outright. Anything stronger than
//! datagrams is a bonus this layer will not notice.
//!
//! **Must:** deliver to the addressed peer and nobody else, and report the
//! sender's address on receive. Identity is load-bearing — inputs are filed
//! per player, so a misattributed packet is a desync.
