//! Agreeing who is playing, before anyone starts.
//!
//! A rollback session needs the player list fixed up front and **identical
//! on every peer**, because handles are positional — if two peers order the
//! roster differently they file each other's inputs against the wrong
//! player, which is a desync with no symptom until the game diverges.
//!
//! The engine has no barrier primitive to build that on (checked: `ready`
//! and `NodeEvent::Ready` are local daemon readiness, unrelated to peers),
//! so this is it. It is deliberately small, because it is not a consensus
//! problem: somebody presses start.
//!
//! 1. Every peer periodically broadcasts [`LobbyMessage::Present`].
//! 2. One peer broadcasts [`LobbyMessage::Start`] with the player list.
//! 3. Everyone in that list — including the proposer — builds a session with
//!    handles assigned by position in the list, which is sorted by public
//!    key so it is the same everywhere.
//!
//! Proposals are ranked by `(epoch, then lower session id)`. The epoch
//! counts matches, so a rematch retires the one before it and a straggler
//! from that older match can never resurrect it. The id breaks a tie
//! between two peers pressing start at once, without a round trip: every
//! peer applies the same rule to the same pair of proposals, so they
//! converge on the same one.
//!
//! What this does *not* do is agree on a moment in time — there is no shared
//! wall clock on a fofoca mesh to agree with. It agrees on *who* and on a
//! logical frame 0; the session's own handshake
//! ([`SessionState::Synchronizing`](crate::SessionState)) aligns the rest.
