//! Creator-issued invites to an **invite-only** mesh. An invite is a bare
//! base58 bearer ticket that carries the mesh's published hash, the invite
//! **root** (the derivation secret that the bare hash withholds), an expiry
//! (TTL), and the creator's signature over those fields. Only the creator —
//! who alone holds the in-memory issuer key — can mint one; any member could
//! package the root, but not a *valid* (creator-signed) invite. See
//! [`crate::mesh`] for the invite-only mesh itself.

mod ticket;

// `InviteTicket` rides the **public** `JoinTarget::Invite`, so it must be at
// least as public as that enum (re-exported at the crate root in `lib.rs`); its
// methods stay `pub(crate)`, so externally it is an opaque join token.
pub use ticket::InviteTicket;
// `pub` so the application layer's `invite` command can mint from the retained
// creator mesh (`EventLoopState::mint_mesh`); `decode`/`redeem` stay
// `pub(crate)` — the engine's own `resolver`/`params` consume them.
pub use ticket::mint;
