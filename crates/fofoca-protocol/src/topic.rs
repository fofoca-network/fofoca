//! The gossip topic identifier, as bytes.
//!
//! iroh-gossip has its own `TopicId`, and this crate used to return it
//! directly. That single type was the only thing tying the wire vocabulary to
//! iroh-gossip — and through it to iroh, tokio and QUIC — for what is really
//! just 32 bytes out of a hash. Keeping a byte-shaped identifier here is what
//! lets `fofoca-protocol` build with neither.
//!
//! `fofoca` converts at the gossip boundary (`daemon::setup`),
//! which is the only place that needs the iroh-gossip type.
