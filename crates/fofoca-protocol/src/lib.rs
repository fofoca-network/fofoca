//! Wire types and seed-derived identities — the vocabulary every consumer

//! **Flat by design.** The implementation is split across submodules (message
//! envelope, mesh identifier, nickname, crypto, sealing, address codec), but
//! they are crate-private and everything lands here: a consumer that needed a
//! `Message` and a `MeshName` and a `Password` used to write three import paths
//! into the engine's file layout, which then could not be rearranged without
//! churning every one of them.

/// **Take it from here, never as your own dependency.** `EndpointAddr`,
/// `RelayUrl` and the key types appear in this crate's public signatures, so a
/// consumer that declares `iroh-base` itself gets the published crate and its
/// values stop being the ones our functions accept — an `E0308` between two
/// types with the same name and version.
///
/// This is the door a consumer with no `fofoca` dependency uses: the wire
/// vocabulary needs `iroh-base` alone (no QUIC, no TLS, no DNS, no tokio), so
/// depending on this crate is far cheaper than depending on the engine, and it
/// still avoids a `[patch.crates-io]` — which cargo honours only in a workspace
/// root and never inherits.
