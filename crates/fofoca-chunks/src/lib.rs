//! Content-addressed chunks over data you already own.
//!
//! A file is a **merkle leaf row**: fixed 64 `KiB` chunks, each addressed by
//! `blake3` of its own bytes, plus an ordered list of those addresses that
//! names the file. Two properties fall out, and the crate exists for both:
//!
//! > **A chunk proves itself.** Hash what arrived, compare it to the address
//! > you asked for. No proof, no tree walk, no outboard — so a chunk is
//! > acceptable from any peer, with zero trust and no per-peer bookkeeping.
//!
//! > **The store never chooses where bytes live.** An origin's file stays
//! > exactly where the user put it; the store holds addresses beside it and
//! > reads through. That is what keeps serving a 500 GB tree a `stat` walk
//! > instead of a full read of it.
//!
//! # Why not bao
//!
//! `BLAKE3` threads a chunk counter into its compression function, so a bao
//! subtree hash is bound to *where* the bytes sit. Excellent as a proof of
//! placement, useless as a content address: the same 64 `KiB` at two offsets
//! hashes two ways, so nothing ever dedups and no peer can answer for a chunk
//! without first agreeing which file and which offset it came from. Placement
//! is proved here by the leaf row instead — leaf *k* belongs at offset
//! *k* × [`CHUNK_BYTES`], and the row is what the root commits to.
//!
//! That is also what separated this crate from the retired `fofoca-blobs`:
//! blobs proved *placement* (bao outboards over one file), chunks proves
//! *content*. This crate replaced it after v0.6.0.
//!
//! # What this crate is not
//!
//! No transport, no ALPN, no framing. No discovery. No download scheduler —
//! that needs peer budgets and connection state, and making it generic is how
//! a blob-transfer library gets rebuilt by accident. No manifests, no shares,
//! no tokens. It takes a hash, some bytes and a chunk map. See
//! `tests/isolation.rs`, which fails the build if that stops being true.
//!
//! # Both runtimes
//!
//! The same store runs under tokio and in a browser, so every future here is
//! `?Send`: an `IndexedDB` backend holds `Rc`-flavoured state and an OPFS one is
//! pinned to a single Worker thread. Callers that need `Send` get it from their
//! own backend, not from this trait.
