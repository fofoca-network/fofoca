//! The kill-gate on the seam: this crate must not know what a share is.
//!
//! `fofoca-chunks` never sees a manifest, a ticket, a mesh, an ALPN or a token.
//! It takes a hash, some bytes and a chunk map. If the trait needs any of those
//! to be useful, the seam is in the wrong place and the crate has quietly
//! become part of the network layer rather than a thing the network layer uses.
//!
//! This is also what keeps the crate *movable*. It is developed here and named
//! for `fofoca-network/fofoca`, where it is meant to land; an edge into
//! `agent-share` or into the iroh family would block that move, and would do so
//! silently until the day someone tried it.
//!
//! A compile-time check would be better than reading the manifest, but a crate
//! cannot ask "am I linked against X" from inside itself. Reading the manifest
//! is the honest approximation, and it fails loudly the moment someone adds the
//! dependency that would make everything easier and the seam meaningless.
