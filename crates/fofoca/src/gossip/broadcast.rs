/// counterpart to the application's own (chain-stamping, sharding, sealing) chat /
/// task builders. A consumer with its own data model emits its `App`-tagged payloads through
/// this one primitive: it stamps the frame with `tag`/`to`/`corr`, signs it with
/// the loop identity, and routes it with the same single-send decision the application
/// path uses ([`crate::transport::deliver`]) — unicast to a sole addressee,
/// gossip for a broadcast (`to == None`).
///
/// Reliability matches the engine's own plumbing: while unmeshed the frame is
/// buffered into `pending_outbound` and flushed through the send decision on
/// the meshed edge; a directed frame whose addressee is still unknown at that
/// flush is re-buffered and retried as `PeerInfo`s arrive (dropped only when
/// the bounded buffer overflows).
///
/// This is a **single-frame** send: unlike the application's chat path it does not split a
/// large body across shards (that logic is entangled with the application's per-author hash
/// chain), so `body` must fit one wire frame. A body whose signed frame would
/// exceed [`MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`] is refused rather than silently dropped by the
/// gossip actor; a bytes-carrying consumer chunks its stream below that bound.
/// It also does **not** seal a directed frame — the recipient's encryption key
/// is discovered through an app-level convention (the application publishes cards to the
/// meta channel) the engine does not own; a directed `App` frame sent here rides
/// in plaintext (authenticated by the Ed25519 frame signature).
///
/// Nor does it seal a **broadcast** body: on a passworded mesh (a
/// `broadcast_key` is set), receivers require every broadcast body to be
/// mesh-key-sealed and drop a plaintext one on decrypt (see
/// `gossip::recv::decrypt_broadcast`). A generic consumer that needs passworded
/// broadcast must therefore seal its body under the mesh key before calling
/// this; the shipped application does so on its broadcast chat path.
///
/// # Errors
/// Refuses a body too large for one frame, propagates a serialize/deliver
/// failure, and errors if the unmeshed buffer is full.
