//! Anti-entropy: periodic digest broadcast + gap-fill resend. Recovers
//! messages a node missed while partitioned/asleep/just-joined.
//!
//! The digest advertises a **window** of the message log: an inclusive
//! `[lo, hi]` timestamp range plus the compact ids the sender holds in it
//! (raw 16-byte UUIDs, Base58-packed, so ~10× more fit one gossip message
//! than the old 36-char strings). A log larger than one window is swept
//! across rounds via a rolling cursor; the `[lo, hi]` bounds let a receiver
//! re-send only **in-window** gaps, so advertising a sub-window never makes
//! peers perpetually re-broadcast the out-of-window remainder.
//!
//! A chat resend rides the same plane the original send chose: broadcast
//! content goes back on gossip, and a directed frame goes point-to-point to
//! its addressee — never to the peer that merely asked. Both follow from
//! routing every chat resend through [`crate::transport::deliver`]. A state
//! or meta answer is the exception: it goes point-to-point to the linked
//! neighbor that asked, see [`handle_state_digest`].
