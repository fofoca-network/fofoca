//! The **gossip subsystem**: the message transport plane. The outbound
//! send plane is [`broadcast`] (broadcast/buffer, presence/`PeerInfo`,
//! the broadcast stdin path); the inbound plane is [`recv`] (the
//! gossip-event pump, neighbor up/down bookkeeping, the per-message
//! router); anti-entropy and the healer are [`antientropy`] / [`heal`].
//! This module itself holds only the shared `conn_path` diagnostic and
//! re-exports the subsystem's public API. Membership/presentation lives
//! in `lifecycle`; this layer never touches the peer roster
//! directly — it calls into `lifecycle::observe` and dispatches by kind.
