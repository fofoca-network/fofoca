//! The **beacon role**: the runtime that co-hosts the rendezvous
//! endpoint — the creator-independent bootstrap anchor.
//!
//! Concept split (see the Concept Glossary in AGENTS.md): *rendezvous*
//! is the seed-derived **identity** (`protocol::crypto`); *beacon*
//! is the **role** a live member plays by binding and serving that
//! identity. This module owns the role; it never derives the identity.
//!
//! A co-hosting member binds a second iroh endpoint to the shared
//! `rendezvous_secret` and glues it into the local mesh via this
//! process's own peer endpoint, so a cold joiner that dials the
//! seed-derived `rendezvous_id` is shuffled into the full mesh.
//!
//! - **Public:** ephemeral port, discoverable by node id via N0 pkarr.
//!   Every member co-hosts permanently; pkarr is last-writer-wins, so
//!   the record always resolves to a recently-live member. Two
//!   `EagerProbed` members can still claim inside each other's probe
//!   window and bind duplicate same-id copies (each capturing its own
//!   bootstrap dial); the event loop's periodic rival re-check shed
//!   (`daemon::event_loop::shed_rival_beacon_if_due`) re-arbitrates, so
//!   the single-co-host invariant holds *eventually*, not at claim time.
//! - **Private:** a deterministic loopback port *ladder* (no
//!   pkarr/DNS). Exactly one member per mesh is the beacon: a member
//!   binds the first free rung; on `AddrInUse` it probes the rung's
//!   node id — *ours* ⇒ the beacon already exists, stay a peer;
//!   *foreign* (an unrelated mesh that derived the same port) ⇒ skip
//!   to the next rung. So independent private meshes on one host never
//!   hijack each other, and there is no second same-identity co-host
//!   for a joiner to mis-connect to. On the beacon's death its rung
//!   frees and the next heal/reclaim tick re-elects.
//!
//! The rendezvous endpoint never authors app messages; its node id is
//! filtered out of peer-side neighbor handling.
