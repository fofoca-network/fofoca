//! The **lifecycle subsystem**: everything about a *peer's*
//! presence over time — heartbeat + membership transitions + the
//! join-horizon surfacing decisions (`joined` / `left` / `peer_return`
//! / `peer_timeout`). The pure gossip router calls [`observe`] for
//! every received message, then dispatches by kind into the
//! presence/msg handlers here. The gossip layer never touches the
//! roster directly — that separation is the layer split documented in
//! the Concept Glossary (AGENTS.md).
