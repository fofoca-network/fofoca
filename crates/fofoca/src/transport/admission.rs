//! Who is allowed to start a `WebRTC` negotiation, and how many at once.
//!
//! One registry for both roles. The dialer asks before offering and the
//! answerer asks before answering, so the direct-peer ceiling means the same
//! thing whichever end of a pair you are on — which it did not, when only the
//! dialer checked.
//!
//! # What a single table buys
//!
//! **The ceiling becomes real.** The role rule (lower id offers) makes the
//! highest-id peer in a mesh a pure answerer. With the cap on the dial side
//! only, every one of its 24 counterparts passed *its own* check and that peer
//! attached all 24 — eight over a ceiling whose own comment claimed to be
//! enforced. The header rendered `24/16`.
//!
//! **In-flight rounds count.** [`Self::try_admit`] is a plain `fn` and the
//! retry tick calls it in a loop with nothing awaited between calls, so
//! `session_count()` alone never moves during a pass: twenty dials each read
//! zero and all twenty were spawned. Counting reservations is what makes the
//! loop self-limiting, and doing it in one lock scope is what makes it correct
//! without ever holding a lock across an await.
//!
//! **Nothing can be pinned forever.** The slot is released by
//! [`AdmissionGuard`]'s `Drop`, so it survives the task being aborted — at
//! shutdown, or when a future is dropped mid-round. The set this replaced was
//! cleared by a statement at the end of the task, which a task that never
//! finishes never reaches: one stalled peer stayed marked in-flight for the
//! life of the process, and every later retry skipped it. That pair was pinned
//! to the relay permanently, which is the exact failure the retry tick exists
//! to prevent.
//!
//! **One peer cannot flood us.** Admission is keyed by the TLS-proven remote
//! id, and the acceptor admits *before* it spawns, so N connections from one
//! peer produce one task and N-1 immediate closes.
