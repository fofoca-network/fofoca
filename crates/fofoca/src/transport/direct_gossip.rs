//! The gossip accept gate: on a mesh whose relay is lookup only, an inbound
//! `GOSSIP_ALPN` connection is handed to iroh-gossip only once iroh has
//! selected a direct path on it. Nothing is read from the connection while
//! it is held, so no gossip frame — membership or payload — crosses the
//! relay. The rendezvous link is gated like every other: it starts on the
//! relay by construction and punches a direct path inside the connection
//! like any peer link. iroh-gossip's dialer has no handshake timeout, so the
//! far side simply waits.
