//! JSEP over Nostr: the same offer and answer as the signal ALPN, carried as
//! sealed, signed events on public relays instead of over an iroh connection.
//!
//! It exists for the mesh with no iroh relay, where the ALPN has nothing to
//! ride on: two peers that have never connected cannot open a connection to
//! exchange the SDP that would let them connect.
//!
//! Identity is the one thing the ALPN got for free and Nostr does not: there
//! the remote id came from the TLS handshake, here it comes from `from`, which
//! [`Opener::open`] has checked against the sender's endpoint signature before
//! anything below reads it.
//!
//! Who offers is the caller's rule, as for the ALPN (the lower id, in
//! `negotiate_session`). Here two peers offering to each other at once each
//! refuse the other as `InFlight` and both rounds run to their deadline.
