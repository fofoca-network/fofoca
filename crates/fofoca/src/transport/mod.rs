//! Everything that moves bytes for the mesh, on either plane:
//!
//! - [`deliver`] — the single cross-plane send decision: a broadcast rides
//!   gossip, a directed message goes over the **unicast** point-to-point QUIC
//!   channel only (`send`).
//! - The unicast plane machinery: the per-peer connection pool (`pool`) and
//!   the inbound acceptor (`accept`). Distinct from `link` (a gossip
//!   active-view neighbor) and from `Reach::Direct` (a gossip-overlay
//!   concept): a unicast connection is a real client/server QUIC link this
//!   node opens to one peer's endpoint, on its own ALPN, off the
//!   gossip flood.
//! - [`MeshSender`] — the gossip broadcast handle (`sender`).
//! - `ipc` — the unix-socket / named-pipe listener used by the CLI's `msg`
//!   and `poll` subcommands to talk to a running `create` or `join` daemon.
//!   (The MCP stdio server is a separate, consumer-side path.)
//!
//! Inbound unicast frames are funnelled into the *same* validation+dispatch
//! path as gossip (`gossip::ingest`), so signature-verify, the mesh gate, and
//! cross-transport dedup are identical on both planes.
