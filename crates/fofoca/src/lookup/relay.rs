//! The relay leg of the lookup layer: the default **relay ladder** (n0
//! prod), how a [`RelayChoice`] maps to an iroh [`RelayMode`], and the
//! deterministic "home on the first reachable rung" bootstrap selection

//!
//! Why a ladder (vs a single pinned relay, or iroh's latency-pick over
//! the set): the cold-join bootstrap needs every member to meet at the
//! *same* relay, and iroh does not reliably race multiple relay
//! candidates in an `EndpointAddr`. So members agree on a fixed order
//! and home on the first reachable rung — under equal relay visibility
//! that is a global function, so all converge on the same rung and fail
//! over together. The public analog of the private loopback-port ladder
//! (`beacon::RendezvousParams::bind_ports`).
