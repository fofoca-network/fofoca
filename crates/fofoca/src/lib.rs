//! `fofoca` — the serverless gossip-network engine.
//!
//! This workspace-internal crate holds the transport-and-protocol engine
//! decoupled from any one application (its data model, its
//! CLI/MCP bindings, the library `api`). It is never published
//! (`publish = false`); a consumer crate depends on it and re-exports
//! the curated public surface.

// ── Role-based public facade ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The modules below are grouped by what a consumer needs, not by the engine's
// internal topology: `protocol` (value types), `embed` (the seams you
// implement), `runtime` (start/stop a node), `ops` (what a hook may do), `net`
// (the quarantined iroh corner), `util` (host helpers). The implementation
// modules they re-export from are crate-private.

// Portable. The node runtime — `setup_mesh` → `Node::spawn` → the event loop —
// is the same on a CLI and in a browser; only the host-shaped *inputs* to it
// (the control socket, the session state file) are gated, inside the module.
// Before this, a wasm build of the crate exposed the protocol types and no way
// whatsoever to run a node, which made the wasm CI leg a compile check of code
// nobody could call.
