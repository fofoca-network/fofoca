//! The CLI (`clap`), the in-process driver (public API), and the MCP server

//! nickname (join) into a [`SetupKind`] plus the resolved author and the
//! directory to advertise into. [`CreateParams`]/[`JoinParams`] are that
//! common shape; `resolve` is the single place the nickname default, the

//! near-identical copies in `cli`, `api`, and `mcp`.
