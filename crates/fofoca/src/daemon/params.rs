//! The shared create/join intent, resolved once for every frontend.
//!
//! The CLI (`clap`), the in-process driver (public API), and the MCP server
//! (`serde`) each have their own native input struct, but they all want the
//! same thing: turn a name + config + nickname (create) or a target +
//! nickname (join) into a [`SetupKind`] plus the resolved author and the
//! directory to advertise into. [`CreateParams`]/[`JoinParams`] are that
//! common shape; `resolve` is the single place the nickname default, the
//! advertise validation, and the target resolution live — instead of three
//! near-identical copies in `cli`, `api`, and `mcp`.
