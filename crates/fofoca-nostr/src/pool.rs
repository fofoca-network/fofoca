//! A pool: one subscriber's view of the relays. It holds the healthiest
//! `width` relays in rank order, publishes to them, and merges what they
//! deliver into one deduplicated stream.
//!
//! Every member of a mesh ranks the same list the same way, so pools of
//! different widths still overlap: a member at width 1 listens on the first
//! healthy relay, which a joiner at width 3 also holds.
//!
//! "Healthy" includes "forwards": a relay can accept every event and deliver
//! none. Our own event coming back on a tag we subscribe to is the proof, so
//! a relay that owes us an echo for too long stops counting toward the width.
