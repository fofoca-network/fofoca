//! A source-routed, multi-hop iroh **custom transport**.
//!
//! Registered on an iroh endpoint via the `unstable-custom-transports` seam,
//! this transport lets a peer reach a destination it cannot dial directly by
//! relaying the destination's QUIC packets through intermediate peers. iroh runs
//! its full QUIC state machine end-to-end, so the two endpoints share a real
//! [`iroh::endpoint::Connection`] (streams, congestion control, QUIC-TLS
//! end-to-end secrecy); the relays only forward opaque, already-encrypted
//! packets.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! - [`Topology`] is the routing brain: a metric-weighted link-state graph fed by
//!   peers' [`LinkVector`]s, producing node-disjoint source [`Route`]s.
//! - A computed [`Route`] is packed into a [`CustomAddr`](iroh_base::CustomAddr)
//!   and travels with the connection; the address lookup resolves a target
//!   endpoint id to one.
//! - [`MultihopHandle`] owns a dedicated **underlay** iroh endpoint that carries
//!   packets hop-by-hop, and wires the transport onto an application endpoint via
//!   its [`Preset`](iroh::endpoint::presets::Preset) impl.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```ignore
//! // A dedicated underlay endpoint the crate forwards over.
//! let underlay = Endpoint::builder(presets::N0).bind().await?;
//! let handle = MultihopHandle::new(app_secret.public(), underlay);
//! // Wire the transport, its address lookup, and the backup path selector.
//! let app = Endpoint::builder(presets::N0)
//!     .secret_key(app_secret)
//!     .preset(handle.clone())
//!     .bind()
//!     .await?;
//! // Feed live link-state so routes can be computed.
//! handle.feed_topology(link_vector);
//! ```
