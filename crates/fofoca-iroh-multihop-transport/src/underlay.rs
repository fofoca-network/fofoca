//! The forwarding **underlay**: a dedicated iroh endpoint that carries opaque
//! QUIC packets hop-by-hop between adjacent relays.
//!
//! The underlay is deliberately a *separate* endpoint from the application
//! endpoint whose packets it relays — the application endpoint is busy being the
//! end-to-end QUIC peer, and could not recursively carry itself. Adjacent hops
//! are link-state neighbours, so their underlay endpoints reach each other over a
//! normal direct/relay path.
//!
//! Outbound: one long-lived writer task per next-hop drains a channel of cells
//! onto a single uni-stream. Inbound ([`ForwardAcceptor`]): each accepted
//! uni-stream is read frame-by-frame; a cell is either forwarded to its next hop
//! or, if this node is the destination, delivered to the local transport — but
//! only after the cell proves it belongs here, since `FORWARD_ALPN` accepts a
//! connection from anyone and an unchecked relay is an amplifying reflector.
