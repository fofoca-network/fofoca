# fofoca-iroh-multihop-transport

A source-routed multi-hop iroh custom transport. A peer reaches a
destination it cannot dial directly by relaying the destination's QUIC
packets through intermediate peers.

iroh runs its full QUIC state machine end-to-end, so the two endpoints
share a real `Connection` with QUIC-TLS secrecy. Relays forward opaque,
already-encrypted packets.

- `Topology` — a metric-weighted link-state graph that produces
  node-disjoint source routes.
- A computed route is packed into a `CustomAddr` and travels with the
  connection.
- `MultihopHandle` — owns a dedicated underlay iroh endpoint that carries
  packets hop by hop.

The crate has no fofoca dependency; any iroh user can take it. A consumer
that patches `iroh` to a fork must patch `iroh-base` to the same repo and
rev, or the graph holds two `iroh_base` versions and `CustomAddr` stops
unifying. See `src/lib.rs` for the API.
