//! Byte streams between two peers, addressed by a hash.
//!
//! A producer [`create`](StreamNode::create)s a stream and hands its
//! [`StreamHash`] to one consumer, which [`open`](StreamNode::open)s it. The
//! bytes ride one QUIC stream on a direct path — hole-punched UDP, or a WebRTC
//! data channel when a browser is on either end — never through gossip. QUIC
//! keeps them in order and paces the producer to the consumer.
//!
//! A stream is 1-1: its hash admits exactly one consumer, and a second one is
//! [`Refused::Taken`]. What goes over it is up to the producer.
