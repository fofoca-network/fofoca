# Changelog

All notable changes to the fofoca workspace. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); all member crates
share one version and move together. A release is a git tag — nothing is
published to a registry; pin it with
`fofoca = { git = "https://github.com/fofoca-network/fofoca", tag = "v0.6.0" }`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `fofoca-stream`: 1-1 byte streams addressed by a hash. A producer creates a
  stream and hands its hash to one consumer. The bytes ride a direct QUIC path
  or a WebRTC data channel, never gossip, and the consumer paces the producer.
  A second consumer is refused (`Refused::Taken`), and a producer dropped
  before it closes abandons the stream (`Refused::Abandoned`).
  `close_or_abandon` ends the stream if a consumer has claimed it and
  abandons it otherwise. It builds for wasm32, so a tab can produce as well
  as read.
- The `fofoca-stream` binary (`crates/fofoca-stream-cli`): stdin to one
  reader, or a hash's stream to stdout. It prints the hash, and with
  `--web-url` the page URL with the hash in its fragment.
- `packages/fofoca-stream-web`: the stream's web page, a static build. `#<hash>`
  reads a stream; no fragment produces one. It registers `stream_write`,
  `stream_close`, `stream_read` and `stream_status` as WebMCP tools, with the
  same functions on `window.stream`.
- Byte streams in the C ABI, ten calls: `fofoca_streams_bind`,
  `fofoca_streams_bind_for`, `fofoca_streams_close`, `fofoca_stream_create`,
  `fofoca_stream_hash`, `fofoca_stream_write`, `fofoca_stream_close`,
  `fofoca_stream_open`, `fofoca_stream_read` and `fofoca_reader_close`, with a
  32-byte `fofoca_stream_opts` (`encodeStreamOpts` in `packages/fofoca-ffi`).
- `fofoca::membership`: the gossip mesh embedding, moved into the engine from
  `fofoca-pipe`. `join` returns a `Membership` that sends and receives whole
  text messages (`msg`). `MAX_MSG` (1408 bytes) is the worst-case bound;
  `msg_fits` says whether a given text fits.
- `fofoca-wasm`: the browser peer, with `fofoca::membership` and the byte
  streams as wasm-bindgen classes, and `packages/fofoca-wasm` as its JS
  backend (`join` for a mesh, `bindStreams` / `bindStreamsFor` for streams).
  `cargo task build-wasm` builds it.
- A custom relay ladder (`relay_urls` / `relayUrls` / `--relay-url`) and the
  per-node path switches (`paths.ip`, `paths.webrtc`; `disable_ip` /
  `disable_webrtc` in C) on every create surface. The ladder is mixed into a
  derived topic id, so every member must pass the same list.
- `fofoca_protocol::Lookup` and `Transport`, the entries of the `lookup` and
  `transport` lists every create surface takes, with `LookupSet::from_lookups`,
  `TransportPolicy::from_transports` and `MeshConfig::resolve` behind them, so
  a consumer parses the two lists and applies the cross-rules with no code of
  its own.
- `cargo task e2e --suite mesh`, `--suite chat` and `--suite stream`: a real
  native peer and a real browser tab on a local plain-HTTP relay. The mesh
  suite sweeps the relay policy, the native transport set and the join mode;
  the stream suite streams bytes both ways between the binary and the page.
  Behind the `mesh` feature of `tasks`, and local-only for now.

### Changed

- **Breaking (C ABI):** the mesh calls are `fofoca_mesh_*`, and a mesh sends
  and receives whole text messages with `fofoca_msg_send` and
  `fofoca_msg_recv` into an 80-byte `fofoca_msg`. A message too big for the
  receive buffer stays queued, and the call returns -2. `fofoca_open`,
  `fofoca_send`, `fofoca_send_eof`, `fofoca_recv`, `fofoca_frame` and
  `fofoca_max_chunk` are gone (`fofoca_max_msg` replaces the last). mallorca
  must rebuild against the new `include/fofoca.h`.
- **Breaking:** the browser peer, `fofoca-api` and the chats send `msg`
  messages over `fofoca::membership` instead of `fofoca-pipe`'s numbered
  byte frames. A peer on the old wire cannot read them.
- **Breaking (TS):** `fofoca-api`'s `Mesh` sends and receives whole text
  messages. `send` takes a `string` only (was `string | Uint8Array`),
  `sendEof` is gone, and `maxChunk` is `maxMsg`. A `Message` is
  `{ from, text, directed }`: `bytes` and `eof` are gone, and `text` is
  always set. The backend seam's `BackendFrame` is `BackendMsg`, and
  `BackendSink.frame` is `BackendSink.msg`.
- **Breaking (C ABI):** `fofoca_opts` is now 72 bytes: the five discovery
  ints (`is_public`, `mdns`, `dht`, `relay_lookup`, `relay_transport`) are
  replaced by two comma-list strings, `lookup` and `transport`, ahead of
  `relay_urls`, and `disable_ip` / `disable_webrtc` follow. A consumer
  compiled against the old header keeps passing the old struct and the
  engine reads it wrong — there is no version field to catch that, so relink
  against the new `include/fofoca.h`. The layout is pinned by a compile-time
  assert in `fofoca-ffi` and by `packages/fofoca-ffi`'s encoder test.
- **Breaking:** every create surface names three mesh-wide choices apart,
  one concept each. `lookup` (`lookup: ['mdns', 'dht', 'relay']`, any
  subset) is how members find each other. `transport` (`['p2p']` or
  `['p2p', 'relay']`) is what payload may ride. `relay_urls` is which relay.
  The `public`, `mdns`, `dht`, `relay_lookup` and `relay_transport` booleans
  are gone; `public: true` is spelled `lookup: ['mdns', 'dht', 'relay']`, and
  naming no lookup is a loopback mesh. A ladder no longer implies the relay
  lookup: both it and `'relay'` in `transport` need `'relay'` in `lookup`,
  and a config that breaks either rule is rejected before any network. The
  per-node switches are `paths` (was `transports`), so "transport" means
  only the mesh-wide policy. In the wasm JSON every old field is an error,
  not a silent no-op. `fofoca_protocol::resolve_lookups` lost its `public`
  parameter. `TransportOpts.relay` keeps its name — it is per-node
  capability, not the mesh policy.
- `MeshConfig::validate` now also rejects a custom relay ladder that would
  not survive the wire (more than 16 rungs, or a URL over 512 bytes). A
  caller-supplied ladder reached the encoder unbounded before: past 255
  rungs it panicked, and between 17 and 255 it minted an id no member could
  decode.
- The chat example lives in `examples/chat/rust` (package `chat`).

### Fixed

- A dial that learned a WebRTC address after iroh had selected the relay
  path stayed on the relay: its Initials went only to the selected path, and
  the custom-transport path was never opened. The pinned iroh fork now fans
  Initials out and opens such paths (fofoca-network/iroh#2, pinned at its
  squash commit `66003af`).
- A beacon holder sheds its rendezvous periodically to re-arbitrate with a
  possible same-id co-host. It now waits, up to three rounds, while a
  data-channel peer depends on that beacon: a browser reaches the mesh
  through the rendezvous and has no second path, so the shed emptied its
  roster mid-transfer.
- A node judged its own need for the `WebRTC` lane from its endpoint address,
  which is empty in a browser whenever the relay link is down; empty read as
  "has IP", so a tab that was the lower id skipped the lane for a native peer
  and stayed relay-only. The pair decision and the rendezvous offer now use
  the node's own transport set (`EventLoopState::local_ip_transport`).
- A negotiated WebRTC session is registered as a transport address, so a
  bare-id dial migrates onto it instead of being refused on the relay.
- An offer from a peer we already hold a session with detaches the old
  session and answers fresh.
- Every `joined` re-floods our `PeerInfo` behind a per-endpoint cooldown, so
  a newcomer or a rejoin across a beacon epoch is not unreachable forever.
- A public rendezvous claim needs two consecutive free probes, so a probe
  inside a live beacon's release window no longer stands up a rival copy.
- A fresh unicast dial waits up to five seconds for a direct path before its
  first frame, which the pool used to refuse as relayed.
- A digest window is bounded by the extent of its slice rather than by its
  first and last entries; the log is in arrival order, so the ends bounded
  nothing and a holder answered "nothing missing" for a gap.
- On a lookup-only mesh the debug census no longer demotes a proven peer on
  a relayed `conn_path` reading, which stopped every payload lane to it.

### Removed

- **Breaking:** `fofoca-pipe`, the byte pipe over gossip. Byte streams are
  `fofoca-stream`, over a direct path; the mesh embedding is
  `fofoca::membership`. The v0.6.0 tag keeps the crate.
- **Breaking:** the `fofoca-blobs` crate, and with it the workspace's only
  OPFS store backend. `fofoca-chunks` is the store: chunks prove content,
  where blobs' bao outboards proved placement. No known consumer imported
  `fofoca_blobs` at removal time; the v0.6.0 tag keeps the crate.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-30

The first tagged release. Everything since the extraction from mallorca.

### Added

- A WebRTC transport for iroh: QUIC datagrams over one unreliable data
  channel, with a native (str0m) and a browser (`RTCPeerConnection`)
  backend, signalled over the iroh relay with no signaling server
  (`fofoca-iroh-webrtc-transport`).
- A multihop transport: source-routed QUIC relaying through peers
  (`fofoca-iroh-multihop-transport`).
- The engine runs in the browser: `--no-default-features` leaves a portable
  core for wasm32, guarded by CI.
- `fofoca-blobs`: a BLAKE3/bao store of verification metadata for bytes the
  caller already owns, with fs, memory, OPFS, and IndexedDB backends.
- `fofoca-chunks`: the content-addressed chunk store, moved in from
  agent-share. Chunks prove content; `fofoca-blobs` outboards prove
  placement. It is meant to replace `fofoca-blobs` eventually.
- The `blob` feature: a point-to-point side channel for oversize payloads,
  with bearer-secret tickets.
- A C ABI (`fofoca-ffi`) and one JS API over it for Bun, Deno, and Node
  (`packages/fofoca-api`, `fofoca-pipe`).
- `fofoca-netplay`: GGPO-style rollback netcode for peer-to-peer games, and
  the light-cycles example that proves it in CI.
- The relay transport policy lives in the mesh id: a mesh can declare its
  relay lookup-only, and members prove a direct path before payload flows.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `MeshConfig` gained a `transport` section, and the default
  relay policy is lookup-only: the relay carries bootstrap, signaling, and
  NAT traversal — no payload. A gossip graft waits for a proven non-relay
  path.
- `blake3` is a workspace dependency with `default-features = false` as the
  floor; crates opt in.

### Fixed

- A browser WebRTC session whose ICE died under an open data channel stayed
  registered forever, blocking every re-dial; the hub now watches
  `connectionState` and evicts (`failed`/`closed` at once, `disconnected`
  after a 10 s grace).
- `swarm-discovery` 0.6.3 span every tokio thread retrying a send to a gone
  mDNS updater; the iroh-address-lookups fork now pins the unreleased
  upstream fix.
- Bounded what a ping, a digest, a blob serve, and the reassembly buffers
  can cost the receive path; bounded the channel orphan buffer; evictions
  come from the fullest author.
- Directed frames no longer reach peers they are not addressed to; documents
  sync over a rendezvous-only link; multihop cells relay only when the route
  names this node.
- Many WebRTC/JSEP hardening fixes: session slots reserved before their
  driver spawns, duplicate sessions refused without killing the survivor,
  STUN replies matched by transaction id, stray datagrams tolerated during
  the handshake, ICE candidates classified by `typ`.
