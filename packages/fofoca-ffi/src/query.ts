 * because it reserves room for the NUL — and otherwise writes *nothing* and
 * returns `needed` anyway. So `cap === needed` looks exactly like a fit to a
 * caller checking `returned <= cap`, and hands back whatever the buffer held
 * before. Asking for `needed + 1` is what makes the second attempt succeed.
 *
 * @param call invokes the C function with a buffer and its capacity, returning
 * the needed length excluding the NUL, or -1 on failure.
 * @param fail raises the thread-local error; must run before any other call.
