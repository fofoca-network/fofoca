# Forked from agent-habilis/agent-gossip

This workspace began as a verbatim vendoring of a subset of
`agent-habilis/agent-gossip` (see `VENDORED.md` for that original contract). It
is now a **fork**: the engine has been split into separate crates, so the
"re-copy the crate directories" update procedure no longer applies.

- **Upstream URL**: https://github.com/agent-habilis/agent-gossip
- **Divergence commit**: `f81b0529ee1b66725295998f15292df1e1ca191c`

Taking an upstream change now means porting it by hand into whichever crate
owns that code. The table under "Where things moved" maps upstream paths to
their new homes.

## Why

`docs/ffi-cost.md` in the mallorca repo measured the engine at **39.4 MiB of
mallorca's 40.7 MiB release binary**, with the engine's own code accounting for
0.75 MiB of `__text` and the rest being its dependency closure. Cargo features
cannot be selected per-consumer across a dependency edge, so making that closure
optional required crate boundaries. `docs/mesh-slimming.md` has the analysis and
the p2panda-derived rules the split follows.

## Crate layout

Dependencies point strictly downward.

```
fofoca-util          no deps of consequence          (13 crates resolved)
  └── fofoca-protocol    + iroh-base                 (138 crates)
        ├── fofoca-doc          + automerge
        ├── fofoca-logging      + tracing-subscriber
        ├── fofoca-reassembly
        ├── fofoca-directory
        └── fofoca         + iroh, iroh-gossip  (436 crates)
              └── fofoca-ffi

fofoca-blobs                    + bao-tree, blake3   (standalone)
fofoca-iroh-webrtc-transport    + iroh, str0m        (standalone)
iroh-multihop-transport         + iroh               (standalone)
```

The bottom three are off the tree: none depends on anything in this workspace.
The engine takes the multihop transport; the other two are a consumer's
business. See carried changes 18, 19 and 20.

The load-bearing property: **only `fofoca` names `iroh`**. `fofoca-protocol`
builds on `iroh-base` alone and pulls no tokio, QUIC, TLS or DNS; `-doc` and
`-logging` inherit that.

## Where things moved

The left column is the path upstream still uses; the right is ours. The whole
workspace was also renamed from `agent-habilis-mesh/` to `fofoca/`.

| upstream path | now |
|---|---|
| `agent-habilis-mesh/src/util/` | `fofoca-util/src/` |
| `agent-habilis-mesh/src/protocol/` | `fofoca-protocol/src/` |
| `agent-habilis-mesh/src/{invite,resolver}/` | `fofoca-protocol/src/{invite,resolver}/` |
| `agent-habilis-mesh/src/doc/` | `fofoca-doc/src/` |
| `agent-habilis-mesh/src/logging/` | `fofoca-logging/src/` |
| `agent-habilis-mesh/src/reassembly/` | `fofoca-reassembly/src/` |
| `agent-habilis-mesh/src/directory/` | `fofoca-directory/src/` |
| `agent-habilis-mesh/src/blob/` | deleted — see carried change 18 |
| `agent-habilis-mesh-ffi` | `fofoca-ffi` |
| everything else | unchanged in `fofoca` (was `agent-habilis-mesh`) |

`fofoca` re-exports `util`, `protocol`, `doc`, `logging`,
`reassembly` and `directory` under their old module paths, so engine-internal
code and the `embed`/`net`/`ops`/`runtime` facades read as before.

## Carried changes

Divergences from upstream, in the order they were made.

**From the original vendoring** (all still in force):

1. Virtual workspace root `Cargo.toml` (upstream has a root package). `resolver
   = "3"` is load-bearing: it stops the `test-fixtures` dev-dep feature folding
   into the shipped binary.
2. `[profile.release]` uses `lto = "thin"`, `codegen-units = 16`,
   `strip = "debuginfo"` rather than upstream's fat-LTO / 1-CGU, for dev-loop
   speed.
3. Upstream's `panic = "abort"` deliberately **not** carried: `ffi.rs` relies on
   `catch_unwind` at the C boundary.
4. FFI extension: a `name` field alongside `nick`, plus `mesh_name()`, across
   `pipe.rs` / `ffi.rs` / `include/mesh.h` / `tests/ffi_smoke.rs`; and the
   `staticlib` crate-type.
5. `tests/c_suite.rs` dropped (it hardcodes paths into upstream `examples/`).

**From the split:**

6. The crate split above, with `pub(crate)` items promoted to `pub` where a
   crate boundary now sits between definition and use.
7. `protocol` no longer depends on `iroh-gossip`. Its `TopicId` is a local
   32-byte newtype (`fofoca-protocol/src/topic.rs`) with a hex `Debug`
   matching iroh-gossip's; `daemon::setup` converts at the two `gossip.subscribe`
   call sites. The `MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE` compile-time tripwire moved to
   `fofoca/src/gossip/mod.rs`, which can still name
   `DEFAULT_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`.
8. New cargo features: `mdns` and `dht` on `fofoca` (default on,
   forwarded by `fofoca-ffi`), and `async-io` on
   `fofoca-util` gating `bounded_read`, which is the only tokio user
   below the engine.
9. Dropped the unused `anstyle` / `anstream` dependencies (zero references).
10. `ops::blob` removed — the blob-transfer crate depended on the engine, so
    the engine could not re-export it. Superseded by carried change 18, which
    deleted that crate.
11. `public-surface.txt` moved to the workspace root and regenerated, since it
    now spans eight crates.

**From the rename:**

12. Everything named for the upstream org was renamed to **fofoca**: the
    directory, all eight crates (`agent-habilis-mesh` → `fofoca`,
    `agent-habilis-mesh-ffi` → `fofoca-ffi`, `agent-habilis-<x>` →
    `fofoca-<x>`), their lib names, the 89 `tracing` targets and the matching
    `log_filter` directives, the C ABI (`mesh_*` → `fofoca_*`, types
    `mesh_{pipe,opts,frame}` → `fofoca_*`), the header (`include/mesh.h` →
    `include/fofoca.h`, guard `FOFOCA_H`), the staticlib
    (`libfofoca_ffi.a`), the blob ALPN (`habilis-mesh/blob/1` →
    `fofoca/blob/1`) and the default mesh name (`"mesh-ffi"` → `"fofoca"`).
    The `github.com/agent-habilis/*` URLs above are upstream repositories and
    are deliberately untouched.

**From the extraction** (moving out of the mallorca repo into its own):

13. `iroh-multihop-transport` left the workspace for
    [its own repo](https://github.com/fofoca-network/iroh-multihop-transport).
    It has no fofoca dependency and its audience is any iroh user. It is now a
    git dependency pinned by rev in `[workspace.dependencies]`. Note that
    `[patch.crates-io]` below still governs it — patch applies from the
    top-level workspace root across the whole graph, git dependencies included.

    **Reversed by carried change 20**, which brought it back as a member.
14. The `iroh` / `iroh-gossip` forks were re-homed from `agent-habilis` to
    `fofoca-network` so this workspace owns its entire pin surface. The commits
    were pushed unchanged, so **the rev SHAs are identical** — only the URLs in
    `[patch.crates-io]` moved.
15. `public-surface.txt` was **deleted**. Nothing in the tree ever generated or
    checked it, so it silently rotted: by the time of the extraction it was
    ~530 entries behind and still listed `iroh-multihop-transport`, which no
    longer lives here. It cannot be faithfully regenerated by grepping for
    `pub` — it tracked the *reachable* API, so `pub` items inside private
    modules were correctly absent. Reinstating it means a real API-extraction
    tool (`cargo public-api`) plus a CI diff, not a shell script.
16. Added the things a standalone repo needs and the vendored copy lacked:
    `LICENSE` (every crate already declared MIT), a root `README.md`, and CI.
    `crates/*/version` moved to `version.workspace = true` — `fofoca-ffi` had
    drifted to `0.0.0` while the rest sat at `0.5.0`.
17. `docs/mesh-slimming.md` came along from mallorca: it is the rationale for
    the crate split, so it belongs beside the crates. `docs/ffi-cost.md` and
    `scripts/measure-ffi-cost.sh` stayed behind — they measure mallorca's
    binary, not this workspace.

**From reclaiming the `fofoca-blobs` name:**

18. The blob-transfer crate — upstream's `agent-habilis-mesh/src/blob/`, carved
    out by change 6 — was **deleted**, and the name reassigned to an unrelated
    crate brought in from `agent-habilis/agent-share`.

    It was dead code here: no `use fofoca_blobs::` anywhere in the workspace, no
    reverse edge in `Cargo.lock`, and `fofoca-ffi` — mallorca's only entry point
    — never depended on it. It is recoverable from history if a consumer ever
    wants it back; upstream `agent-gossip` still carries it under `src/blob/`.

    What took the name is a BLAKE3/bao verified-byte-range store: outboards,
    chunk availability, and a `BlobStore` seam over bytes the caller already
    owns, with in-memory, filesystem, OPFS and `IndexedDB` backends. It shares
    no code, no wire format and no dependency with what it replaced — the two
    crates only ever shared a name.

    Two invariants got stronger as a result. "Only `fofoca` and `-blobs` name
    `iroh`" became **only `fofoca` names `iroh`**, and the dependency graph lost
    its one upward edge: the new crate depends on nothing in this workspace, so
    it sits beside the tree rather than above the engine. Its own
    `tests/isolation.rs` is what keeps that true.

19. `fofoca-iroh-webrtc-transport` arrived from the same repo. It is an iroh
    custom transport carrying QUIC datagrams over a WebRTC data channel, and it
    is what lets a browser reach a peer at all — a tab has no UDP socket, so
    iroh's own paths do not exist there. Like `fofoca-blobs` it depends on
    nothing else here, so it sits beside the tree.

    Its two backends were renamed on the way in: `host` → **`native`** and
    `web` stayed, along with `src/host/` → `src/native/`. `host` collided with
    the engine's own `host` feature, which means something related but not the
    same, and the pair now says plainly which of two mutually exclusive
    implementations gets compiled.

    The `iroh` requirement stays at `1.0.1` rather than moving to this
    workspace's `1.0.2`. The crate is still consumed from `agent-share`, whose
    patch table supplies 1.0.1; a `1.0.2` floor would be unsatisfiable there.
    Raise it once both sides pin the same fork.

    CI grew four steps for it. Neither backend is on by default, so every
    existing job built neither, and the `web` half had never been linted at all
    — `agent-share` only ever ran `cargo check` against wasm32, never clippy.
    Its first clippy pass produced 18 findings, all fixed here.

20. `iroh-multihop-transport` came back as a member, reversing change 13, and
    `agent-share`'s vendored copy of it was deleted in favour of this one. There
    were three copies of this crate in circulation; now there is one.

    The reasoning in 13 still holds — it has no fofoca dependency and its
    audience is any iroh user — but a separate repo bought nothing and cost a
    rev pin to bump on every change. What it was protecting is a property of the
    *manifest*, not of the repository: the crate still names only crates.io
    `iroh`/`iroh-base`, and nothing here may leak into it.

    Its `iroh` requirement was lowered from `1.0.2` to `1.0.1` on the way in.
    `agent-share` patches `iroh` to a 1.0.1 fork, and a `1.0.2` requirement is
    not satisfied by 1.0.1 — so cargo would ignore that patch, resolve unpatched
    crates.io alongside it, and put two `iroh_base` crates in the graph, at
    which point `CustomAddr` stops unifying (E0308). `agent-share`'s vendored
    copy had already been lowered for exactly this reason; the split to a
    separate repo had silently undone it, and consuming that version would have
    reintroduced the bug. `1.0.1` is satisfied by both forks.

    The now-unused [standalone repo](https://github.com/fofoca-network/iroh-multihop-transport)
    is superseded, not deleted.

21. Every dependency named by more than one crate now lives in
    `[workspace.dependencies]` and nowhere else. Members opt in with
    `dep.workspace = true` and may union in extra features, but no member
    restates a version.

    This started as tidiness and is not: `iroh` sat at `1.0.2` in the workspace
    while both transports named `1.0.1` locally. Nothing had broken yet, but two
    versions of `iroh`/`iroh-base` in one graph is precisely how a
    `CustomTransport` impl stops satisfying the trait iroh hands back, and the
    E0308 it produces points nowhere near the manifests that caused it.

    `iroh` and `iroh-base` also moved to `default-features = false`. A member
    cannot turn off default features that the workspace entry turns on, and the
    WebRTC transport's browser backend must have them off — iroh's defaults drag
    `tokio/net` → `mio`, which refuses to build for wasm32. So the off position
    lives at the root and `fofoca` re-adds `metrics`, `portmapper` and
    `fast-apple-datapath` by name, `fofoca-protocol` re-adds `relay`.

    `noq-udp`, `n0-watcher`, `wasm-bindgen`, `wasm-bindgen-futures`, `js-sys`
    and `web-sys` moved up at the same time, each having been named by two
    crates.

22. **The engine builds for the browser.** `agent-habilis/agent-share` had been
    carrying a vendored fork of the engine since it needed a wasm32 peer, and
    that fork's changes came back here — the last and largest of the moves.

    The two histories were one commit apart: agent-share vendored
    `agent-gossip@8914557`, this workspace forked at `f81b0529`. So this was a
    real three-way merge rather than a hand-reconciliation. 54 of 83 files
    merged clean; the 86 conflicts were almost all the same shape — the split
    and rename on one side, a `host` gate or a de-glyphed doc line on the
    other — and resolving them meant taking both.

    What arrived:

    - A **`host` feature**, on by default, in every crate. Off, what is left is
      the portable engine: gossip, the CRDT documents, the protocol and
      identity types, address lookup, the whole node runtime. `interprocess`,
      `libc`, signals, processes and the filesystem have no wasm32 equivalent
      and are gone with it. It has to exist in six places because the split put
      the host-only code in six crates, so `fofoca/host` forwards to each leaf.
    - **A portable clock.** `fofoca-util::clock` is now `web-time`, which off
      wasm32 *is* `std::time` and pulls in nothing. Without it every
      `Instant::now()` in the portable core panics in a browser — and
      `unix_secs` stamps every `Message`, so a browser peer could not author a
      single frame. The failure is invisible to `cargo check`, which is what
      `tests/wasm_runtime.rs` exists to catch.
    - **The WebRTC lane**, `transport/webrtc.rs` and `transport/admission.rs`,
      wiring the transport crate into the engine. `TransportHandles` and
      `TransportOpts` in `lookup` replace a growing positional argument list,
      and `TransportOpts` is deliberately *not* part of the mesh id: a browser
      only ever has relay and WebRTC, so baking transports into mesh identity
      would mean a browser could never join a mesh a CLI created.
    - Fixes that were never wasm-related and are worth having on their own: the
      beacon sheds on every release path instead of being dropped, its
      probe-before-claim runs off the event loop, a peer retains its own
      broadcasts so anti-entropy can converge, and native peers stay off the
      WebRTC lane.

    Two knock-on manifest changes: `tokio` and `iroh-gossip` in
    `[workspace.dependencies]` dropped to a portable floor with
    `default-features = false`, since a member cannot turn off defaults the
    workspace turns on; and `.cargo/config.toml` now carries the
    `getrandom_backend` rustflag, which `getrandom` 0.3+ requires and says so
    in a `compile_error!`.

23. A `clippy.toml`, aligned with agent-share's. Most of this workspace is now
    code written under that configuration, and without the file the two repos
    disagree on every configurable lint even though their `[workspace.lints]`
    match. One deliberate divergence, documented in the file:
    `warn-on-all-wildcard-imports` cannot hold here, because the `protocol` and
    `util` facades are `pub use fofoca_protocol::*` — the mechanism by which
    the split crates keep their old module paths.

## Patch pins — do not drop

`[patch.crates-io]` in the workspace root pins `iroh`, `iroh-base` and
`iroh-dns` to `fofoca-network/iroh` rev `f9cb1f4fd1b69e904770516029fa0afac0fd3ce4`
(mapped_addrs eviction + relay teardown fixes) and `iroh-gossip` to
`fofoca-network/iroh-gossip` rev
`c779c0661fc9429e86852570be9bdc00fb47fdd9` (connection-churn leak fix).

`iroh-base` must stay pinned to the **same repo and rev as `iroh`**: the forked
`iroh` uses its workspace-local copy, and mixing that with the crates.io release
puts two `iroh_base` versions in the graph, which makes types from
iroh-gossip and the address-lookup crates fail to unify (E0308).

## Verifying a change

```
cargo check --workspace            # also: --no-default-features, --all-features
cargo test --workspace             # 19 suites, 411 tests
```

From a [mallorca](https://github.com/dviramontes/mallorca) checkout, `just check`
and `just test` build the staticlib and the Odin app against it — the real check
that the C ABI is unchanged. mallorca pins this repo by rev in its `Justfile`
(`fofoca_rev`) and clones it under `fofoca/`, so the loop is: edit here, run
`just check` there, then bump `fofoca_rev` once the change is pushed.
