//! `cargo task benchmark` — bulk throughput over the transports.
//!
//! One question: is the iroh↔WebRTC integration the bottleneck? So the cells
//! are fofoca over WebRTC in every pairing that exists — browser↔browser,
//! browser↔native, native↔native — read against two ceilings: plain iroh on
//! UDP, and a bare data channel with no QUIC in it at all.
//!
//! Every cell moves the same bulk protocol (`fofoca_iroh_webrtc_transport::
//! bench`) over one QUIC bi-stream, times it on the receiving side only, and
//! asserts which path carried it — a cell that claims WebRTC and quietly ran
//! on UDP is a wrong number, not a fast one. The JSEP round is timed
//! separately and kept out of the throughput window.
