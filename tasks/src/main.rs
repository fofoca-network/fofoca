//! Task runner for the workspace. Run `cargo task <task>` from anywhere in it.
//!
//! Two jobs. The first is the quality gate: everything
//! `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs — the clippy passes for features that are
//! off by default, the doc-link check, the wasm32 half — lives in
//! [`gate::STEPS`] as data, so a contributor can run the gate instead of
//! transcribing YAML, and can narrow it to one crate with `-p`.
//!
//! The second is `e2e`, which is a runner for a different reason: the WebRTC
//! crate's browser tests need a preamble that is four things long, and every one
//! of them fails in a way that does not name its cause. Homebrew clang or
//! `ring`'s C core silently does not link; `--release` or the wasm is too big to
//! load; a matching driver or session creation 404s; the browser's mDNS switch
//! or ICE never leaves `new`. A runner that gets all four right is the
//! difference between a suite anyone can run and one only its author can.
