//!
//! Every clippy, check, and test invocation in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is
//! one row of [`STEPS`], in the workflow's order. Two things follow from that.
//!
//! One, the gate is readable in a single screen instead of being spread across
//! a hundred lines of YAML and shell continuations, and `cargo task ci` is
//! provably the same list rather than a sincere attempt at the same list.
//!
//! Two, `-p` is a filter over the table rather than a second code path. A task
//! scoped to one crate keeps that crate's rows and drops the rest, so a scoped
//! run can never quietly diverge from the full run — there is only one
//! description of what a crate needs.
